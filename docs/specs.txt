=======================
Benchmark specification
=======================

Notes attempting to detangle the benchmarking process.

Application configuration parameters:
   - Algorithm/calculation (major subroutines)
   - Total FLOP count
      - FLOP count for major subroutines
   - Total memory
      - Memory per rank (as a function of rank count)
   - MPI message count, distribution of message sizes 

Application benchmark metrics:
   - Runtime
   - FLOP/sec
   - Memory bandwidth (GB/sec)
      - Interconnect
      - RAM <-> CPU
      - Cache (if applicable)

Metric contexts:
   - Total time
   - Initialisation, Main loop, Finalise
   - Major subroutines (i.e. top 5 functions as relative runtime)
   - Scalability over multiple CPU counts

Process:
- Identify current metric needs
- Evaluate capacity of available hardware
